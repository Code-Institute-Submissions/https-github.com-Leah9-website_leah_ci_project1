                    <h1> <i class="fa fa-asterisk fa-fw w3-margin-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>IOT, MQTT, Python, ESP32
                        Devkit</h1>

                    <p>I have recently researched MQTT / MQ Telemetry Transport a very lightweight messaging protocol
                        designed for IOT / Internet of Things.
                        I have been using a direct MySQL connection from the sensor to my Rasberry Pi server up until
                        now but it has proved unreliable especially over a poor connection.</p>
                    <p>The ESP32 is a very capable micro-controller that costs less than Â£5, it can be programmed in C
                        or MicroPython.
                        For this project I will use C as I have already written the code for obtaining the sensor
                        redings from the DHT22's and it would be boring if I did everything the easy way in Python.
                        The ESP32-DevKitC looks like this.</p>
                    <img src="/images/ESP32.jpg" alt="ESP32">
                    <p>The specification can be found at <a
                            href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc"
                            target="_blank">https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc</a>. It is
                        available in a variety of DevKits or as individual chips for integration into a user / company
                        designed PCB.
                        I am quite interested in getting hold of a few of the ESP32-Azure IoT Kit versions to experiment
                        with <a
                            href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-azure-kit/overview">https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-azure-kit/overview</a>.
                        They have a built in Lipo charge controller that would mean one less soldering job for my
                        sensors.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are several parts involved in this project :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MQTT Broker - Mosquitto runs on Raspberry Pi server</li>
                        <li>Python Library - paho-mqtt</li>
                        <li>Python script - MQTT Subscriber</li>
                        <li>C Library = PubSubClient</li>
                        <li>ESP32 with DHT22 sensors</li>
                        <li>Program to read sensor data and publish MQTT messages</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The flow of data for the complete system is a as follows</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ESP32 reads data from DHT2 sensors</li>
                        <li>ESP32 connects to WiFi and transmitts MQTT messages containing temperature and humidity data
                        </li>
                        <li>ESP32 enters deep sleep mode for 10 minutes to conserve power</li>
                        <li>MQTT Broker receives the data and forwards it to the Python script that is subscribed to the
                            relevant topics</li>
                        <li>Python script checks the data and if valid enters it into the database</li>
                        <li>Data can be viewed using Grafana and associated dashboards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After a few false starts I managed to get my first message posted to the broker and the Python
                        script received and printed to the screen.
                        This took a little longer than expected as I had issues with Arduino IDE taking several minutes
                        to compile the project before it would upload to the ESP32.
                        I had to completley change IDE and configure Platform IO in VS Code. This reduced the compile
                        and upload time to less than two minutes meaning I could make and test code changes much faster.
